"@AmericanAir So i was visiting SJU and was returning to Paris and they checked my bag at the gate in SJU, i arrived in paris and nothing,(1)",0
@AmericanAir Can you check on he status of my EXP membership card? Need the physical card to access some international lounges soon.,1
@AmericanAir you called back just to put me on hold. It's midnight. Literally just want to know how I'm getting home and I'm getting no help,0
@AmericanAir Yes and without my bags. 2 first class tickets to Tahiti would be nice. Just saying,0
@AmericanAir Err 2 hour wait time for the Exec. Plat. line?,0
@AmericanAir ... Do I have to even say anything?  Over 6 hours on hold... No one has ever sucked as much as you. http://t.co/NcrMqIBIWo,0
"@AmericanAir Finally got a call from AA, but it was an automated voice that hung up on me! I called back &amp; it says it'll be 2 more hours.",0
@AmericanAir I've been on hold ANOTHER hour and still nothing. My Cancelled Flighted flight was supposed to be six hours from now. #Stranded,0
"@AmericanAir will do. I'd think, though, that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update?",1
@AmericanAir  you have now lost my luggage for40 hours holding for4 hrs on phone #wtf is this how you treat your loyal passengers?#stranded,0
@AmericanAir the service received by both of us was rude and well below my expectations of your airline. That is what's most frustrating,0
@AmericanAir sounding like they just got bitch-slapped by @juliasinton948,0
@AmericanAir can someone actually either call back or help me figure out how I'm getting home??!,0
"@AmericanAir  I was told it would be emailed to me, but I haven't received anything yet. How can I follow-up?",0
"@AmericanAir Thanks, she did her best. Staying the night in Dallas, new trial to Detroit via Atlanta tomorrow, assuming no Cancelled Flightlations.",0
@AmericanAir Thanks! Are they really open 3.30 am - 7 pm every day? Any way to check they are open before going all the way there? Thanks.,2
@AmericanAir I'm going to speak with customer service at the airport tomorrow morning and see what my options are. I need a flight tomorrow,1
@AmericanAir by far the best example of the worst company @Cowboycerrone,0
@AmericanAir we made it so no worries... You guys did good tonight and even put @ESPN_CoachMack on my flight #firstclass,2
"@AmericanAir Yes, but should be able to get a push notification via the app if I‚Äôm logged in and on a trip. Email/text is so 2010 üò•.",0
@AmericanAir why are you still selling tickets when you haven't rebooked people to arrive at their destinations on time?,0
@AmericanAir @ti2469 oh shiz i'm only 40 minutes into my wait after the first 3 hour barrier ...unbelievable,0
"@AmericanAir its not that, it's the rude agent who wouldn't listen to anything I would say and it clearly fit into the sizer",0
